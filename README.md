Microservice Apps and APIs
==========================

This was part of a course assignment of course Microservice Apps and APIs. It contains 3 microservices which comprise a student management system. The services are as follows:
- Student Microservice
- Course Microservice
- Registration Microservice

The project uses RabbitMQ for communication across services. This ensures eventual consistency across microservices.
